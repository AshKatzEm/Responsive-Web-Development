                 <!-- The .main-section elements should contain at least five li items total (not each) -->
                 <ul>
                    <li>SQL stands for Structured Query Language</li>
                    <li>SQL lets you access and manipulate databases</li>
                    <li>SQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986, and of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987</li>
                 </ul> 

                 <!-- The .main-section elements should contain at least ten p elements total (not each) -->
                 <p>Although SQL is an ANSI/ISO standard, there are different versions of the SQL language.</p>
                 <p>However, to be compliant with the ANSI standard, they all support at least the major commands (such as SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, INSERT, WHERE) in a similar manner.</p>

                <p> To work with SQL, you will need a RDBMS. This stands for Relational Database Management System.

                    RDBMS is the basis for SQL, and for all modern database systems such as MS SQL Server, IBM DB2, Oracle, MySQL, and Microsoft Access.
                    
                    The data in RDBMS is stored in database objects called tables. A table is a collection of related data entries and it consists of columns and rows, like this "Customers" table:.</p>

                 <!-- The .main-section elements should contain at least five code elements total (not each) -->
                 <code>SELECT * FROM Customers;</code>

                 <h2>SQL Statements</h2>

                 <!-- The .main-section elements should contain at least ten p elements total (not each) -->
                 <p>Most of the actions you need to perform on a database are done with SQL statements.</p>
                 <p>SQL statements consists of keywords that are easy to understand.</p>
                 <p>The following SQL statement returns all records from a table named "Customers":</p>

                 <!-- The .main-section elements should contain at least five code elements total (not each) -->
                 <code>SELECT * FROM Customers;</code>

                 <ul>
                 <li>SQL keywords are NOT case sensitive: <code>select</code> is the same as <code>SELECT</code></li>
                  <li>SELECT - extracts data from a database</li>
                <li>UPDATE - updates data in a database</li>
                <li>DELETE - deletes data from a database</li>
                <li>INSERT INTO - inserts new data into a database</li>
